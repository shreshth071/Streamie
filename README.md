# Streamie

A simple front-end web project for browsing/streaming movies (or video content) — built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript.  

## 🧩 What is Streamie

The goal is to provide a minimal, easy-to-use movie-browsing interface, with no heavy backend required (static hosting supported).  

## ✨ Features

- Responsive UI built with HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript (no frameworks)  
- Browse movie/video listings  
- Play selected video in the browser  
- Clean layout and intuitive design
